# Data Story: "The Ride to Success"

Adventure Works, a thriving e-commerce and retail brand, has built its success on high-quality bikes and accessories. Over the years, sales trends have shown significant growth, with North America leading the charts.

One of the top-selling products, the Mountain-200 Black (42), has been a customer favorite, contributing significantly to revenue despite a relatively high return rate. This highlights the need for quality assessment and possible improvements to reduce returns while maintaining sales.

Seasonality trends suggest that customers prefer purchasing bikes during mid-year, possibly for summer adventures. By leveraging these insights, Adventure Works can optimize inventory, target marketing campaigns, and introduce promotions during peak seasons.

With Power BI, we have transformed raw data into actionable business insights, paving the way for smarter decision-making and a stronger competitive edge in the market.
